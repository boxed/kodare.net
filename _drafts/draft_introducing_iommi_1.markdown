title: Introducing iommi

I am very excited to reveal something me and my colleague Johan LÃ¼bcke have
been working on for quite some time now: [iommi](http://iommi.rocks). This
is a high level framework built on top of [Django](https://djangoproject.com).

This library is a union of our previous libraries tri.form, tri.query and
tri.table but we've collected all our grievances and architectural problems
and dealt with them the way you can only do if you are free to let go of
backwards compatibility. We've also added some new features built on this
new foundation that we've been thinking about for a few years.

This is primarily a library for developing traditional web apps, but we believe
it's also a solid foundation to build SPAs and APIs going forward. Watch this
space. But for now, let's get started!

I will build a discography app (you can find the code on [github](https://github.com/boxed/Supernaut) with separate 
commits for each stage of the apps evolution). To make this simpler for demo
purposes I will put all my views inside `urls.py` so we don't need to jump
around between different files too much.

This is where we will end up at the end of this 2 part blog series:

4 pages (plus the admin), with custom table, row, cell rendering, filtering,
pagination, the advanced query language, and a menu.

## Django setup

Let's create the venv:

```bash
mkdir Supernaut
cd Supernaut
virtualenv -p $(which python3) venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Then create a Django project, and the main app:

```bash
django-admin startproject Supernaut
cd Supernaut
django-admin startapp Supernaut
cd ..
```

## Django models

We create these models:

```python
from django.db import models


class Artist(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255, db_index=True)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name

    class Meta:
        ordering = ('name',)


class Album(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255, db_index=True)
    artist = models.ForeignKey(
        Artist, 
        on_delete=models.CASCADE, 
        related_name='albums'
    )
    year = models.IntegerField()

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name

    class Meta:
        ordering = ('name',)


class Track(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255, db_index=True)
    index = models.IntegerField()
    album = models.ForeignKey(
        Album, 
        on_delete=models.CASCADE, 
        related_name='tracks'
    )
    duration = models.CharField(
        max_length=255,
        db_index=False, 
        null=True, 
        blank=True
    )

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name

    class Meta:
        ordering = ('index',)
```

Create migrations and run them to create our database tables:

```bash
./manage.py makemigrations
./manage.py migrate
```

The real project also has a little database that it creates [with pre filled data](https://github.com/boxed/Supernaut/commit/2b8df08877375c0285c86fe0108116aec8f5122a#diff-8c129e9d099a80d052bb28ffefcdef14R1).

## The most basic app

We'll start with the simplest app we can think of, creating a `base.html`, `index.html` and a very simple `index` view:

`base.html`: 
```html
{% raw %}<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>{% block title %}{{ title }}{% endblock %}</title>

    {# jQuery #}
    <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.4.1.js" integrity="sha256-WpOohJOqMqqyKL9FccASB9O0KwACQJpFTUBLTYOVvVU="   crossorigin="anonymous"></script>

    {# Bootstrap #}
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.4.1/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-Vkoo8x4CGsO3+Hhxv8T/Q5PaXtkKtu6ug5TOeNV6gBiFeWPGFN9MuhOf23Q9Ifjh" crossorigin="anonymous">

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="//maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.3.0/css/font-awesome.min.css">

    {# jQuery first, then Popper.js, then Bootstrap JS #}
    {# Note that bootstrap tells you to use the slim version of jQuery but this does NOT work with select2! #}
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/popper.js@1.16.0/dist/umd/popper.min.js" integrity="sha384-Q6E9RHvbIyZFJoft+2mJbHaEWldlvI9IOYy5n3zV9zzTtmI3UksdQRVvoxMfooAo" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
    <script src="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.4.1/js/bootstrap.min.js" integrity="sha384-wfSDF2E50Y2D1uUdj0O3uMBJnjuUD4Ih7YwaYd1iqfktj0Uod8GCExl3Og8ifwB6" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>

    {# Select2 #}
    <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/select2@4.0.12/dist/css/select2.min.css" rel="stylesheet" />
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/select2@4.0.12/dist/js/select2.min.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
    <div class="container">
        {% block content %}{% endblock %}
    </div>
</body>
</html>{% endraw %}
```

`index.html`:

```html
{% raw %}{% extends "base.html" %}

{% block content %}
    <h1>{{ title }}</h1>

    {{ content }}
{% endblock %}{% endraw %}
```

`urls.py`:

```python
from django.shortcuts import render
from django.urls import path

# Views ----------------------------

def index(request):
    return render(
        request,
        template_name='index.html',
        context=dict(
            content='hello',
            title='Title here!',
        )
    )


# URLs -----------------------------

urlpatterns = [
    path('', index),
]
```

So now that we have a foundation to stand on we will build out the app step by step. 


## Install iommi

```bash
pip install iommi
```

In `Supernaut/settings.py`, we add `iommi` to `INSTALLED_APPS` and `iommi.middleware` to `MIDDLEWARE`:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # [...snip...]
    'iommi',
    'Supernaut',
]

MIDDLEWARE = [
    # [...snip...]
    'iommi.middleware',
]
```

## Declarative table

We'll start with using iommi declarative tables to create a list of albums:

```python
# [... snip ... ]

from iommi import (
    Table,
    Column,
)

# [... snip ... ]

# Tables ---------------------------

class AlbumsTable(Table):
    name = Column()
    artist = Column()
    year = Column()


# Views ----------------------------

def index(request):
    return render(
        request,
        template_name='index.html',
        context=dict(
            content='hello',
            content=AlbumsTable(
                rows=Album.objects.all(),
            ).bind(request=request),
            title='Title here!',
        )
    )
``` 

### What is bind()?
`Table()` creates a table definition, and `bind()` couples it to the request,
 this is when it can do the sorting defined by http parameters for example.
 `bind()` returns a new `Table` that is "bound" and can be rendered.


## Simplify!

We can simplify the above quite a bit due to iommis middleware and built in
templates. First we'll delete our `base.html` because iommi has one. Next up
is simplifying the `index` view:

```python
def index(request):
    return AlbumsTable(
        title='Albums',
        rows=Album.objects.all(),
    )
```

The iommi middleware will handle if you return an iommi type and render it
properly. 

## Using as_view

The two parameters `title` and `rows` we passed to `AlbumsTable` can also be
set on the `Meta` class like this:

```python
class AlbumsTable(Table):
    name = Column()
    artist = Column()
    year = Column()

    class Meta:
        title = 'Albums'
        rows = Album.objects.all()
```

(These are defaults so we can still create an `AlbumsTable(title='Something else')` if we want.) 

Now that we have the above we can delete the `index` view altogether and
replace the url definition with this:

```python
urlpatterns = [
    path('', AlbumsTable().as_view()),
]
```

(We could have also passed the `title` and `rows` parameters here, but that's
not as nice I think.)


## auto__model

The next step in the simplification is to realize that this table is trivially
derived from the model definition. iommi has features to do this for you so we
can simplify even further! We delete the entire `AlbumsTable` class and replace
the url definition with this single line:

```python
urlpatterns = [
    path('', Table(auto__model=Album).as_view()),
]
```

The code above gives you this view:

![](/img/introducing-iommi-part1-table.png)

(The only cheat is that I've passed `page_size=10` to make the screenshot smaller.) 

The title of this table is the plural verbose name of the `Album` model. Again
as stated above, these are all defaults, not hard values, so you can pass 
`title` to the `Table` constructor here to override the title for example.
