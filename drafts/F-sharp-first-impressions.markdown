- F# syntax seems like a much nicer version of OCaml
- The Visual Studio for Mac installation procedure is pretty bad. You download a big installer but then it still has to download lots more. Why can’t the initial download be much smaller then? You have to baby sit the installer because it prompts for password seemingly randomly in the middle a few times (it’s only ok to have a password prompt ONCE and only at the very beginning or very end). There’s no progress indicator (a simple “5 of 10" steps would suffice). At the very end it tells me to install XCode, something that also takes a lot of time and could have been done in parallel had the installer told me at the beginning.
- Visual Studio for Mac seems a bit rough. Starting a project and pressing run might or might not work depending on your default shell. You can sort of fix it but then pressing run puts the output in a panel hidden by default that isn’t shown automatically.
- Visual Studio for Mac is a lot prettier than what I’m used to with PyCharm. But I guess I’ll make it uglier soon with my preferred color scheme of Turbo C++ 3.0 :P If I can just find out how to make a theme, why does this seem hard?
- There’s an iPhone app to play with F# but it’s pretty bad compared to Pythonista. Crashes a lot for one.
