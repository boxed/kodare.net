I got this question:

> How do y'all get the ball rolling when you feel like you can't focus?  Once I'm in the flow it's not a problem, but sometimes I struggle to get into it.

I prioritize momentum over everything else. If something feels too heavy, I look for something simpler or more fun. That scales down all the way to super trivial stuff or even hobby projects. It's better to prioritize teaching your brain that programming is fun and is done at speed than it is that you're doing "real work" on the clock (and hobby projects have a tendency to end up helping you with your day job anyway).

What matters is whether you can deliver results sustained over the long haul. Focus on that.
