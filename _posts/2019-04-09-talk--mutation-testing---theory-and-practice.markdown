  I did a talk about mutation testing that is now [up on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8Yje1XDkk). It's pretty short at ~20 minutes excluding the live demo.

As is often the case, the live demo didn't go very well. I managed to figure out the problem: the library I worked on has Cython parts and I didn't force it to use the pure python version of the code. If I did it again I would first delete all the .so files and it would work fine ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Hope you like the rest of the talk!
