My wife once said that programming must be terrible because you're always confused and frustrated. I laughed a bit but then I thought about it. 

I think it's largely true that programming is frustrating because if you're not confused and frustrated you're in the groove and going at light speed. You only spend significant amounts of time on anything when you're stuck. When you get better you go fast more, it's just that this time is even shorter because you're going REALLY fast past it. 

All this adds up to roughly all time being spent frustrated and confused. You gotta learn to accept that, and to take joy in finally solving that thorny problem you spent 6 hours on (even if it was just a missing comma!). 

So yes: programming is frustrating. But it's also super satisfying when you pull it off.
