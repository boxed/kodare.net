## Pages

So far we've just created a table, but often you want something a little more
complex, especially for your index page. iommi has a concept of a `Page` that
is used to build up a bigger page from smaller building blocks. Let's build
out our simple web app to have separate pages for albums, artists and tracks:

```python
path('albums/', Table(auto__model=Album).as_view()),
path('artists/', Table(auto__model=Artist).as_view()),
path('tracks/', Table(auto__model=Track).as_view()),
``` 

and an index page:

```python
class IndexPage(Page):
    title = html.h1('Supernaut')
    welcome_text = 'This is a discography of the best acts in music!'

    artists = Table(auto__model=Artist, page_size=5)
    albums = Table(auto__model=Album, page_size=5)
    tracks = Table(auto__model=Track, page_size=5)
```

with a url definition like this:

```python
path('', IndexPage().as_view()),
```

`html` is a little fragment builder to make it easier and faster to build
small html parts. `html.div('foo')` is just a more convenient way to write
`Fragment(tag='div', children__text='foo')`. Fragments are used internally
throughout iommi, because they allow you to define a small bit of html that
can be customized later. Let's look at an example:

```python
>>> class MyPage(Page):
...    title = html.h1('Supernaut')

>>> MyPage().bind().__html__()
'<h1>Supernaut</h1>'

>>> MyPage(parts__title__attrs__class__foo=True).bind().__html__()
'<h1 class="foo">Supernaut</h1>'
```

This is used throughout iommi to provide good defaults that can be customized
easily when needed.

A `Page` can contain any `Part` (like `Fragment`, `Table`, `Form`, `Menu`, 
etc), or plain strings. Escaping is handled like you'd expect from Django
where strings are escaped, and you can use `mark_safe` to send your raw
html straight through. 

For our demo we'll also introduce a page for an artist:

```python
def artist_page(request, artist):
    artist = get_object_or_404(Artist, name=artist)

    class ArtistPage(Page):
        title = html.h1(artist.name)

        albums = Table(auto__rows=Album.objects.filter(artist=artist))
        tracks = Table(auto__rows=Track.objects.filter(album__artist=artist))

    return ArtistPage()

urlpatterns = [
    # [...snip...]
    path('artist/<artist>/', artist_page),
]
```

Note here how we specify `auto__rows` to supply a `QuerySet` instead of a
model. This is very convenient in many cases, and is otherwise the same as
specifying `auto__model` and `rows`.


## cell__format

In iommi you can customize the rendering on many different levels, depending
on what the situation requires. The last layer of customization is
`format` which is used to convert the value of a cell to a string that
is inserted into the html (or CSV or whatever output format you are targeting):

```python
class IndexPage(Page):
    # [...snip...]
    albums = Table(
        # [...snip...]
        columns__artist__cell__format=lambda value, **_: 
            format_html('<a href="/artist/{}/">{}</a>', value, value)
    )
    # [...snip...]
```

`columns__artist__cell__format` should be read as something similar to
`columns.artist.cell.format`. This way of jumping namespace with `__` instead
of `.` (because `.` is syntactically invalid!) is something Django started 
doing for query sets and we really like it so we've taken this concept further
and it is now everywhere in iommi.

The other levels of customization are `value` which is how the value is 
extracted from the row, `attr` which is the attribute that is read (if
you don't customize `value`), and lastly `template` which you use to override
the entire rendering of the cell (including the `td` tag!). 

You can also override `template` on the row to customize the row rendering.
Again this includes the `tr` tag.


## cell__url

A very common case of tables is to show a link in the cell. You can do that
with `cell_format` and `cell__template` like above, but it's such a common
case that we supply a special convenience method `cell__url` for this. Let's
make the artist column link to the artist page in our table. First we add
a `get_absolute_url` on the model, then replace the 
`columns__artist__cell__format` we had above with:

```python
class IndexPage(Page):
    # [...snip...]
    albums = Table(
        # [...snip...]
        columns__artist__cell__url=lambda value, **_: value.get_absolute_url(),
    )
    # [...snip...]
```

Much better!

But actually, this is such a common case that we do this by default for you
for `ForeignKey` columns if the target model has `get_absolute_url`. So we
can just remove the `columns__artist__cell__url` specification entirely. But 
we do want the *name* column to link to the album page so the total definition
becomes:

```python
    albums = Table(
        auto__model=Album,
        page_size=5,
        columns__name__cell__url=lambda row, **_: row.get_absolute_url(),
    )
``` 


## Table filters

It's very often we want the ability to filter lists, which is why iommi also
provides this. To enable a filter make sure `include` is `True` for the `filter`
of a column. We enable filtering for `name`, `year`, and `artist`:

```python
    albums = Table(
        # [...snip...]
        columns__name__filter__include=True,
        columns__year__filter__include=True,
        columns__year__filter__field__include=False,
        columns__artist__filter__include=True,
    )
```

`columns__year__filter__field__include=False` means we turn off the `Field` in
the form that is created, but we can still search for the year in the
advanced search language. 

To handle selecting from a choice field that is backed by a `QuerySet` that
can contain thousands or millions of rows, iommi by default uses a select2
filter control with an automatic ajax endpoint. You can read more about this 
in the full documentation. The automatic endpoint is handled by iommi on the
same url as the view. An advantage to this approach is that we only need
to be sure our view has the correct permission checks and then we also know
the select box (or ajax endpoint) has the same checks. This makes it easy to
reason about the security of the product. 

The advanced filter means users can write queries like `year>1960 and title:war`
to find albums published after 1960 and that contain the word "war".


## Forms

iommi also comes with a library for forms. This can look very much like the
forms library built into Django, but is different in some crucial ways. Let's
look at the most basic example from the Django documentation:

```python
from django import forms

class NameForm(forms.Form):
    your_name = forms.CharField(label='Your name')
``` 

```html
{% raw %}<form action="/your-name/" method="post">
    {% csrf_token %}
    {{ form }}
    <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>{% endraw %}
```

In iommi the same is written as:

```python
from iommi import Form, Field

class NameForm(Form):
    your_name = Field.text()
```

And in the template:

```html
{% raw %}
{{ form }}
{% endraw %}
```

In iommi you always get a form encoding specified on the form, so they all work
with file uploads. Missing form encoding on the form tag is a very common 
stumbling block for beginners. You also get a submit action by default which
you can configure via `actions__submit`:


```python
from iommi import Form, Field

class NameForm(Form):
    your_name = Field.text()

    class Meta:
        actions__submit__display_name = 'Save'
```

In iommi we use `class Meta` a lot, similar to Django, but in iommi it's not
just a bucket of values that someone might or might not read, it has a precise
definition: values in `Meta` are passed into the constructor. So the example
above is roughly the same as:

```python
NameForm(actions__submit__display_name='Save')
```

Worth pointing out is that values of `Meta` are defaults, so you can still
override at the constructor call.

An advantage to this strict definition is that we don't have silent failures
in iommi. If you make a spelling mistake in a value in `Meta`, you will get
an error message.


## Automatic forms

iommi can also derive forms from Django model definitions: 
`Form(auto__model=Artist)`. You can specify which fields to include or exclude
via `auto__include` or `auto__exclude`, and the fields can still be customized
fully. An example of this could be to insert a CSS class `foo` on the label
tag of a field `name`: 

```python
form = Form(
    auto__model=Artist,
    fields__name__label__attrs__class__foo=True,
)
```

There are many many more customizations options available, you can find more
in the [HOWTO](https://docs.iommi.rocks/en/latest/howto.html) and the docs
for [`Field`](https://docs.iommi.rocks/en/latest/Field.html).


## Automatic views

iommi goes a step further than this though, by supplying full views that can
be used from either a declarative form or an auto generated form. An example
is to have a create view for an `Artist`:

```python
urlpatterns = [
    path('create/', Form.create(auto__model=Artist).as_view()),
] 
``` 

There are three built in forms/views like this: `create`, `edit`, and `delete`.
The `delete` view is a read only form with some styling for the submit button
and a submit handler that delete the object. We find this to be really nice as
a confirmation page because you can see what you are about to delete.


## Actions

An `Action` in iommi is a link or a button. We use them for submit buttons of
forms and for links that you can add to a part. A common use case is to add
links to a table. In our example app we want to add a create button for staff:

```python
class AdminTable(Table):    
    # [...snip...]
    class Meta:
        # [...snip...]
        actions__create_album = Action(
            attrs__href='/albums/create/', 
            include=lambda request, **_: request.user.is_staff,
        )
```

## cell__template

Now that we have a basic app, we'd like to customize the look of the index page
a bit. A plain html table with text doesn't look very cool, so we will spice it
up with album covers. This is what it looks right now:

![](/img/introducing-iommi-plain-index-page.png) 

We'll start by removing the artists section. 

A custom cell template might be a good start to make it look nicer. The 
[demo app](https://github.com/boxed/supernaut) ships with images, we just need
to link to them:

```python
{% raw %}albums = Table(
    auto__model=Album,
    columns__album_art=Column(
        attr=None,
        cell__template=Template('''
            <td>
                <img 
                    height="30"
                    src="/static/album_art/{{ row.artist }}/{{ row.name }}.jpg">
            </td>
        '''),
    ),
){% endraw %}
```

![](/img/introducing-iommi-custom-cells-index-page.png)

That's a start, but we want something a bit more showy, let's get rid of html
tables entirely:

## row__template

To override the rendering of an entire row we use `cell__template`. We also
change the table from rendering a `table` tag to a `div`, and turn off the 
table header:

```python
{% raw %}albums = AlbumTable(
    tag='div',
    header__template=None,
    row__template=Template("""
        <div class="card" style="width: 15rem; display: inline-block;" {{ cells.attrs }}>
            <img class="card-img-top" src="/static/album_art/{{ row.artist }}/{{ row.name|urlencode }}.jpg">
            <div class="card-body text-center">
                <h5>{{ cells.name }}</h5>
                <p class="card-text">
                    {{ cells.artist }}
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>
    """),
){% endraw %}
```

(You can specify the name of a template file here instead of writing the
template inline like this. This way is nicer for small things and quick demos.)

Now we're almost at the full app screenshot at the beginning of part 1, we just
have the menu at the top left.

![](/img/introducing-iommi-custom-rows-index-page.png)

## Menus

iommi also has a menu system. It follows the same patterns we've seen so far.
For this example app we'll do something simple:

```python
class SupernautMenu(Menu):
    home = MenuItem(url='/')
    artists = MenuItem()
    albums = MenuItem()
    tracks = MenuItem()
```

By default the url becomes the name, so the artists menu item becomes `/artists/`.

Adding it to the index page:

```python
class IndexPage(Page):
    menu = SupernautMenu()

    # [...snip...]
```

and we've arrived at the screenshot I promised at the beginning of part 1:

![](/img/introducing_iommi_1.png)

Just one more thing... 

## Admin

With these high level abstractions we've seen so far (pages, tables, queries, 
forms, fragments) we can easily build more powerful components. Which is what
we've done with the administration interface built into iommi. Installing it
is as simple as:

```python
class MyAdmin(Admin):
    class Meta:
        pass


urlpatterns = [
    path('iommi-admin/', include(MyAdmin.urls())),
]
```


Customization is easy with `IOMMI_DEBUG` on (default on if `DEBUG` is on), 
here's how to use the pick tool:

<video controls><source src="/img/iommi-admin-customization.mp4"></video>


You can override an entire field rendering with `template`, the template 
of the label with `label__template`, the name of a field with `display_name`,
add a CSS class to the label tag with `label__attrs__class__foo=True`, and 
much more. Customization is at all levels, and in all these cases you can
supply a callable for even more flexibility.

## Wrap up

I'm glad you read this far! This has been a very shallow introduction, but
I've touched on all the major parts in some way, and there is a lot of
material to cover. I hope you want to give iommi a try.
