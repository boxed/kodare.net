- Ask something specific

- Before asking for help, try to make the smallest example you can of the problem. Don't just show us your entire code base.
- If you don't understand the advice given, *say so!*. Don't just ignore it. 
- Don't tell us error messages in your own words. Copy paste them. In full.
- "Doesn't work" is not an error message. How does it not work? What happened? What did you expect to happen?

If you follow these rules you will learn faster, get help faster, and people will like you more. Learning and internalizing these rules is the most important thing you can do for your programming career.
